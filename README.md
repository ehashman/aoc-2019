# Advent of Code 2019

I'm learning Guile! It's pretty cool!

You should be able to run this code by installing Guile 2.2 and executing the
source files directly. For example,

```
elana@silverpine:~/src/aoc$ aoc/d01.scm
5035632
elana@silverpine:~/src/aoc$ test/01.scm
5035632
%%%% Starting test puzzle-1  (Writing full log to "puzzle-1.log")
# of expected passes      4
%%%% Starting test puzzle-2  (Writing full log to "puzzle-2.log")
# of expected passes      7
```
